This repo contains the source code for a Final Exam Grade Calculator, 
something that many college (and high school) students use.

This calculator allows you to calculate the required Final Exam grade to meet
a desired course grade, based on the current course grade and the weight of
the final exam (the percent of the course grade determined by the final).

The app is deployed using GitHub CI/CD to Azure. The website can be found here:
https://webapp-xiezc3pdz7pmo.azurewebsites.net/. The site is hosted with
Microsoft's free tier Azure plan for students, so I can't guarantee anything
with regards to uptime.
