# ERAU CS 399 2024 
## CI/CD
Here we will create an Azure App service, allow your GitHub repository to publish to Azure, and create a Github Action to test and deploy your app
## Azure
###  Creating an App Service
Create an App Service app using an ARM template: (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-arm-template?pivots=platform-linux)
Before moving forward, consider [Azure App Service on Linux pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/linux/) and 
change the ```sku``` accordingly.

Consider, modifying the link below, so that it points to the ```./arm/app_service.json``` file in your repository.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnrdave%2Fcicd24%2Fmain%2Farm%2Fapp_service.json)

Clicking the button will log you into Azure and create an Azure App Service as it is declared in the ./arm/app_service.json file.

Select an existing, or create a new Resource Group, then click "review and create". 

If you using the free Sku (F1), make sure you are not already running a Linux/Python app in the selected region.

### Add a secret in your repository
- Create a secret in your repository and name it AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE. Paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
